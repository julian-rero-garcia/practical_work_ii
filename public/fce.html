        <h2>Course Content</h2>
        <p>
            The course is structured to provide a comprehensive introduction to
            Computer Engineering through a combination of theoretical knowledge
            and practical skills. Its content is divided into two main parts:
            theoretical foundations and applied practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            The theoretical component begins with an exploration of Computer
            Engineering in society, examining its historical development, its
            present role, and its future evolution. This includes an analysis of
            Computer Engineering as both an academic discipline and a profession,
            as well as the competencies expected of computer engineers. Special
            attention is given to ethical principles, professional responsibility,
            and deontological codes that guide engineering practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            The course then addresses current paradigms and trends in computer
            systems and applications. Students are introduced to the structure of
            computer systems, encompassing hardware, software, operating systems,
            and networks. Emerging technological paradigms such as Artificial
            Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Quantum Computing, Blockchain, Smart
            Cities, and the Internet of Things are presented to provide a broad
            view of contemporary and future developments in the field.
        </p>

        <p>
            A further block is devoted to information and data. This includes the
            representation of information in digital systems, the organization
            and management of data, foundational concepts of Big Data, and the
            legal and ethical considerations associated with data processing and
            use.
        </p>

        <p>
            The practical component of the course focuses on an introduction to
            software and web development. Students learn fundamental concepts of
            web technologies, version control systems such as Git and GitHub, and
            the creation and design of web pages using HTML5 and CSS3. These
            contents are applied through a project aimed at developing a web-based
            application related to the themes of the course.
        </p>

        <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
        <p>
            The primary objective of the course is to provide students with a
            global vision of Computer Engineering, enabling them to understand
            its purpose and its impact on society. The course seeks to encourage
            reflection on the role of technology in promoting human well-being
            and social development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another key objective is to establish the foundational principles
            that underpin technological progress. By acquiring a historical
            perspective on computing, students are expected to recognize the
            driving forces behind innovation and technological change.
        </p>

        <p>
            The course also aims to highlight the importance of the human factor
            in engineering practice. It promotes ethical awareness, a vocation
            of service, and a commitment to the common good as essential elements
            of the professional identity of a computer engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, the course seeks to familiarize students with the
            professional landscape of Computer Engineering. By presenting the
            various fields and career paths within the discipline, it encourages
            students to reflect on their own vocational interests and future
            professional development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, the course introduces current computing paradigms and basic
            technical skills, particularly in relation to data management and web
            development, as a foundation for more advanced studies.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            Upon successful completion of the course, students are expected to
            demonstrate a foundational understanding of computer systems,
            programming concepts, operating systems, and data-related
            technologies, and to recognize their application in engineering
            contexts.
        </p>

        <p>Students should be able to describe the structure, organization, operation, and interconnection of computer systems, as well as explain the basic principles of hardware, software, and networks.</p>
        <p>
            They are expected to correctly use technical terminology related to
            Computer Engineering and to identify key historical milestones in the
            evolution of computing, as well as analyze emerging and future trends
            in the discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            The course also aims for students to understand and apply mechanisms
            for representing and organizing numerical and non-numerical
            information within digital systems, taking into account legal and
            ethical considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a practical perspective, students should be capable of designing
            and developing a basic web-based application and of researching,
            documenting, and presenting a computing project clearly and
            effectively, both in written and oral form.
